This project needs to be merged into littleape.

It exists for historical reasons.
And needs to be converted to use the same technology that littleape used.


## Environment Variables

This has some environment variables that need to be set:

```
VITE_APP_GREATAPE_VERSION=0.0.1-alpha
VITE_APP_DEBUG_MODE=true
VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL_WS_LOCAL=localhost:8080
VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL_WS_DEPLOYED=logjam.example
VITE_APP_LOCAL_ENV=false
```

Replace `logjam.example` with the Internet-domain of your LogJam server.

Replae `0.0.1-alpha` with the current version of LittleApe.
